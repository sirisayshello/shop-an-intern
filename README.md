# shop-an-intern

This is partly my portfolio and also a kind of online store. ðŸŒŸ  

As part of my internship search and wanting to showcase my skills to potential employers, I wanted to create something enjoyable. This project is a playful take on an online store where you can browse products (representing my skillset), add items to your cart, select payment options, and complete your purchase.

The tools used in this project are React and Tailwind.
